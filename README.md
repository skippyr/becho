# Becho

"Becho" is a terminal utility written in Rust that aims to be a replacement for
the UNIX `echo` command by providing more useful flags to:

  + align text to left, center or right.
  + style text with colors, bold and blinking.
  + choose left and right indentation of the text.
  + add prefix to the first line or all lines of text.
  + add sufix to the first line or all lines of text.
  + wrap text after a certain number of characters by
    considering only characters or words.
