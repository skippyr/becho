# Becho

`becho` is a terminal utility designed to help you treat, style and print text
to the standard output. It is my rethink of the `echo` command with new features
mixed with features that you can find in other commands like `tr`, `fmt` and
`fold`.

As the name implies, `becho` means `better echo`. It is the tool that you have
been missing for a long time to properly create beautiful and maintanable shell
scripts.

It should work in both Linux and MacOS.
