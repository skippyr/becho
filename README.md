# Becho

`becho` is a terminal utility designed to help you treat, style and print text
to the standard output. As the name implies, `becho` means `better echo`: 
it is my rethink of the `echo` command with new features mixed with features
that you can find in other commands like `tr`, `fmt` and `fold`, but, this
time, done right.

It is the tool that you have been missing for a long time to properly create
beautiful and maintanable shell scripts.

It should work in both Linux and MacOS.


## What features it has?
`becho` can:

  + change the foreground and background color of a text and apply dim colors.
  + place a separator between the arguments.
  + apply bold, italic, underline and crossed out text.
  + change the case of your text to a variety of cases.
  + escape new line (\n), tab (\t) and escape (\e, \x1b and \033) characters.
  + repeat the output a desired number of times.
  + adjust left indentation with colored symbols.
  + wrap text properly even with styles.
  + ignore empty arguments.


## Preview

Here you can see screenshots of some real examples using `becho` in some
scripts.

    ```
   

### Docker Installation

There is a Docker image in this repository that comes with `becho`
pre-installed. You can use it to test it.


## More Information

If you are an user, please refer to the manual of `becho` after you install it by
using `becho --help` or `man becho`.

If you are a developer, you can use `cargo` to compile the internal
documentation and open it in your default browser by using `cargo doc --open`.
